# graphics_sandbox
sandbox for learning 3D &lt;-> 2D transformation in the graphics pipeline

# credits
- a lot of the "shared" folder files come from the university course I took on computer graphics (Professor James Stewart - Queen's University) <br>
    - gpuProgram for compiling v and f shaders, and the linalg helpers <br>
    - other helpers / reusable wrappers around simple 3D shape vertices (cubes, spheres etc.) <br>

# objective
- the M, R and MVP projects are my own, with the objective and creating a conceptual and visual depiction of the series of transformations involved with rendering the 3D world to a 2D display
