- the "shared" folder I copy verbatim from the university course I took on computer graphics (Professor James Stewart - Queen's University) <br>
    - gpuProgram for compiling v and f shaders, and the linalg helpers <br>
    - other helpers <br>
- everything else I will be implementing through my own understanding while still referencing old assignments and examples. Some will still be copied but will be commented for readability
